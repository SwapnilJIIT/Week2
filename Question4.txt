Link of Dijkstra Algo Repo for analysis : https://github.com/bgcorreia/activity05_apa

The repo displays a basic but solid implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm.
There are no fancy things used but at the same time all the things are fundatmentally sound.

[Line - 8]  Graph class is being created. Creating classs is always a good practice.

[Line - 14] Adjacency list is begin used for storing Graph.

[Line - 32:36] A basic function to add edge between two nodes.

Line - 39: 105] Actual dijkstra functionality is coded.

Here the person has used a visited array for keeping track of nodes which are already visisted.
This is however redundant as the array strong the closest distance is sufficent to keep track of visited nodes.
